<p>Note for the reader: MC belong to the initials of MainCharacter, and the term “hit points” (hp) is only a synonym for health points of the Characters. Hitbox is also a name for the area in which a character, enemy, hearts or doors can be touched. Also, sprite is the name of the characters, background, hearts ,and doors images.</p>

Also it checks if the doors should be open, if the MC is attacking, if the MC is attacked, if the enemies are attacked, if the room is clear and the most important, it uses the method that generates the random movement of the enemies. This method has the counter that counts 3 seconds (Aprox.) in which when the character is attacked, he is immune.
